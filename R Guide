R Vectors 
Vectors are characterized by their size and type of the elemets 
All elelmts HAVE to be of the same type in vector 
Vectors are index-based and you can can acess the elements by their position (index)
Can create a vector with the command c() 
ex - melons <- c(3.4,3.1,3,4.5)
to access the weight of melon 1 we would use melons[1]
